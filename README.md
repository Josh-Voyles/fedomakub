# Fedomakub

Transform a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development environment by running a single command. Inspired by Omakub's vision for Ubuntu, Fedomakub brings the same streamlined setup to Fedora users. No need to craft custom configurations for each essential tool or keep up with the latest command-line utilities. This project aims to embody what Linux can be at its best on Fedora.
